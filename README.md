Scraping tripadvisor website to obtain informational list of restaurants in Łódź.
Next step is scraping reviews of each restaurant in order to train a sentiment classifier.
This will be a background to build an interactive web app with Dash, Flask and PostgreSQL.
The app is going to be dockerized and deployed to AWS.
